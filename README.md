# SimpleRTC
A low feature implementation of the WebRTC protocol using websockets as a 
signaling channel.

# Installation
All you need is `npm install` to set everything up, then run `node start.js`

# Tests
Currently test coverage is poor until I gain a better understanding of 
how to test with websockets. Any help is appreciated.
