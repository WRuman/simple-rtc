# SimpleRTC
A low feature implementation of browser-to-browser audiovisual communictaion
using the WebRTC protocol with websockets as a signaling channel.

A Node.js-based websocket server is included.

# Installation
All you need is `npm install` to set everything up, then run `node start.js`

# Tests
Currently test coverage is poor until I gain a better understanding of 
how to test websockets. Tests are run with `mocha`.

# Contributions
All contributions are welcome! If you have a feature in mind, just fork the 
code and have at it.
